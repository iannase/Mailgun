# Mailgun
Python files that use Mailgun's API
# Get statistics from message tags (mailgun.py)
In this implementation, we have used 4 different tags, the first is LrgEm##, then LrgEm##a, LrgEm##b, and LrgEm##c. This gets the summation of all these tags and bases the results on those numbers. The user only has to enter the first one (LrgEm##).

This one gets the email addresses of hard bounces, unsubscribes, and complaints and puts them into excel files so that you can later upload them for deletion.
